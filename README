cdfs-sim: The XMM-CDFS simulator
    This is a general purpose, multi-mission X-ray simulator. It has been
    written to produce simulations of the XMM-Newton survey in the Chandra
    Deep Field South (the deepest XMM pointing made to date, consisting of
    33 individual observations centred on the CDFS), which are needed to
    test the accuracy and completeness of the souce catalogue. Please refer
    to the paper: "Ranalli, Comastri, Carrera, Vignali et al., 2013,
    Astronomy and Astrophysics 555, A42".

    The simulator has also been written with the mission project formerly
    known as XEUS/IXO/Athena in mind, so that it can readily be updated to
    other mission. The only assumptions are that a library of
    position-dependent PSFs is available, that the effective area of the
    telescope and detector is known, and that an exposure map is provided to
    account for vignetting and eventual chip gaps. A background map can be
    used to account for the instrumental component.

  Features:
    * produces event files, to be analyzed with common X-ray data analysis
    software;

    * supports an arbitrary number of sources;

    * arbitrary spectra can be assigned to the sources;

    * calculates the most appropriate PSF for each source, according to
    position and energy, by interpolating from the PSF library;

    * reproduces the correct balance of background components (cosmic,
    particle and residual soft protons) - though this features is not yet
    included in the public version.

  About this version
    This public version only includes the simulations of point sources (and
    cosmic background, if you include a large number of faint sources with
    the correct flux distribution). Simulations of instrumental background
    will be added in the next public verion.

  DISCLAIMER
    This software is provided AS IS and with NO WARRANTY, and with very
    limited support. Please consider it as a BETA version.

Installation
    You need a working Ftools (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/), XMM
    SAS (http://xmm.esa.int/sas/) and PDL (http://pdl.perl.org/) environment
    on a Unix machine (e.g., GNU/Linux or Mac OS X).

    To install Ftools and SAS, please follow instructions on the respective
    webpages. With SAS, remember to also download the calibration files
    (CCF). At least the following ones should be present in the $CCFPATH
    directory:

     XRT1_XAREAEF_0008.CCF
     XRT2_XAREAEF_0009.CCF
     XRT3_XAREAEF_0011.CCF
     XRT1_XPSF_0013.CCF
     XRT2_XPSF_0013.CCF
     XRT3_XPSF_0013.CCF

    If you don't have these files or if you have other versions, please
    download them from the FTP site:
    ftp://xmm.esac.esa.int/pub/ccf/constituents .

    For PDL, the easiest way to install it in Linux it is from your
    distribution package manager (e.g. "sudo apt-get install pdl" should
    probably work on Mint and Ubuntu). For the Mac, the SciPDL distribution
    offers a one-click installer (see the PDL site); or otherwise you may
    use Macports or Fink. There is no particular requirement on the PDL
    version, so just install whatever version your distribution offers.

    To install the simulator, just create a new directory and extract the
    archive in it. (If you are reading this document, probably you have
    already done this step, and you may consider the simulator installed).

Documentation
    The essential documentation is included in the program and may be seen
    with the command:

    perldoc obsid-sim.pl

    Further info is available on the website
    http://www.astro.noa.gr/~ranalli/cdfssim and, for the theory behind the
    simulator, on the Ranalli et al. (2013) paper.

Running the simulator
    Before running the simulator, you need to have an event file and an
    exposure map: just use any you have around from XMM-Newton observations.
    The camera, pointing position, and roll angle will be taken from the
    event file, while the exposure will be set by the expmap.

    Then, you need a source list. It is an ascii file with four columns, and
    one row for each source. The columns are:

     1. mos count rate
     2. pn count rate
     3. ra
     4. dec

    The program will warn if any source falls outside the field of view, and
    will proceed with the sources within the FOV; you may safely ignore
    these warnings (unless of course you expected all the sources to fall
    inside the FOV...).

    You need a spectrum: open Xspec (*), define any model, and give the
    commands:

     XSPEC> iplot model
     IPLOT> wd spectrum

    and then editing the file spectrum.qdp to remove the commands (READ SERR
    etc.) at its beginning.

    An example source list (counts-pos.dat) and spectrum
    (gamma1.7nh2e20.qdp) are included in the package. (NB the count rates in
    the example list are extremely faint and the positions are in the CDFS -
    it's just to show the file format).

    (*) Xspec may be obtained together with the Ftools from
    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/download.html . It
    is not a requisite for running the simulator - just use the example
    spectrum included here for your tests.

    Finally, choose a name for you output file (the simulated event list)
    and call the simulator:

     ./obsid-sim.pl \
     counts-positions.dat spectrum.qdp real-event-file.fits \
     expmap.fits sim.fits [--pimin=2] [--pimax=10]

    where the file names may be changed (it is only the order that matters)
    and the square brackets mean that the pimin/pimax parameters are
    optional; 2 and 10 keV are their default values. The simulator only
    produces photons inside the pimin/pimax limits; you may freely choose
    them.

    The simulator should then run for a minute or probably less. The
    simulated event list should be readable by ds9, Ftools and by any SAS
    tool (though with warnings sometimes).

Questions and answers
   > What do you use to calculate the PSF?
    I use the 2-dimensional PSF images which can be found in the CCFs. There
    are about one hundred PSF images, valid for different energies and
    different off-axis angles (and, in recent SASs, for different cameras).
    The simulator interpolates the PSFs from this library, and rotates the
    interpolated PSF to match the observation position angle. A user-defined
    spectrum is used to weight the interpolation.

   > What input does the simulator need?
    The input to the simulator is:

    * an event file, from which the main details are taken (camera, exposure
    time, boresight, position angle) * a spectrum * an exposure map * a list
    of sources (with count rate, ra, dec of each source)

    The spectrum is just an ascii file, which can be produced with xspec by
    defining a model, a dummyrsp, and giving the commands iplot model; wd
    spectrum.

   > What output does it provide?
    The output is an event file, which can be processed (hopefully) like any
    other XMM-Newton event file.

   > Can I use this simulator for Chandra/eRosita/Athena/any other X-ray
  mission?
    Short answer: not yet. Contact me for this.

    Long answer: it is possible by providing the correct input files, and by
    modifying the source to use relevant calibration files for the effective
    area and PSF. This is currently hard-wired, and only the XMM CCF format
    is currently included. Changing this is however simple, so just contact
    me.

   > What do you use for the input spectrum?
    Currently, a simple power-law (gamma=1.7) with galactic absorption. It's
    the same model used for the count-rate to flux conversion in the
    XMM-CDFS catalogue.

   > Which kind of X-ray events does this program simulate?
    The complete simulator as used for the Ranalli et al. (2013) paper
    consists of four programs: - the source+CXB simulator - a background
    analyzer, to be used on a real observation to determine the
    CXB-particle-proton fractions - the particle simulator - the proton
    simulator

    However, currently I am only releasing the first one (source+CXB). The
    other parts need to be decoupled from the XMM-CDFS simulation pipeline
    where their development took place, and some time is needed to polish
    their user interfaces.
